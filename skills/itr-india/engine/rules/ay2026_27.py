# "Section 2 in The Income Tax Act, 1961" — contains clause (42A). CAVEAT: this
# mirror pre-dates Finance (No.2) Act 2024 (base definition still reads "36
# months"; the 2014 date-conditional proviso is unchanged). It DOES corroborate
# holding.listed_equity.lt_months=12 (first proviso: units of an equity-oriented
# fund / UTI / zero-coupon bond / other listed non-unit securities -> 12 months)
# and holding.other.lt_months=24 (third proviso: unlisted shares / immovable
# property -> 24 months). It does NOT corroborate holding.listed_nonequity's
# 12-month value or its acquisition-date condition — that reclassification of
# listed non-equity units (e.g. gold ETFs) is a Finance (No.2) Act 2024 change
# not present on this page. Left as the least-bad available deep primary
# because it is still on-point for two of the three holding.* rules and is not
# a search URL; the listed_nonequity gap is called out in the report for the
# controller to adjudicate (a fresher primary should be sourced later).

# "Section 24 in The Finance Act, 2023" — the enacting provision that inserts
# s.50AA into the Income-tax Act; contains "Specified Mutual Fund" and the
# "1st day of April, 2023" effective-date language, which corroborates
# s50aa.acquired_from directly. CAVEAT: the fetched text truncated before the
# deeming-as-short-term-capital-gains language, so s50aa.applies ("always
# short-term, any holding") is corroborated by inference from "Notwithstanding
# anything contained in clause (42A) of section 2 or section 48" (an explicit
# override of the normal holding-period test), not by directly-read deeming
# text. Also note (not a value/citation defect, flagged for the record): this
# section's own commencement clause reads "with effect from the 1st day of
# April, 2024" — standard Finance Act drafting for "applicable from AY
# 2024-25" (PY 2023-24, beginning 1-Apr-2023), consistent with this rule's
# effective_from=2023-04-01, but worth a second look if this rule is revisited.
